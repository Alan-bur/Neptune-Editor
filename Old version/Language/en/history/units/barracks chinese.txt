Click the Barracks to train a new Chinese soldier or to research improvements in the quality of the soldier available. The capabilities of the soldier are also partly determined by improvements in armor and weaponry, which can be researched at the Armory.

All civilizations the world has seen so far have had the need to train soldiers at the very least for defensive purposes, if not for aggression, against their neighbors. For many, this training took place at a barracks, which served both as living quarters and training ground. New recruits were assigned to the barracks and after a training period they were ready for service. At the barracks they learned the mechanics of their weapons, the drill of battlefield movements, and the discipline required to obey orders in combat.
