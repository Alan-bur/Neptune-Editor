A regent is a ruler of the empire. Regents were often considered temporary rulers for various reasons such as the successor to the throne being a minor, or the royal line having died out. Much like the king, however, the regent is the head of the empire and with his death comes the end. When a Regicide game is played, the regent must survive at all costs for when he dies, the game is lost.
