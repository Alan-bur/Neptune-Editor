The White Tiger, also known as the White Tiger of the West, is a mythological creature representing the Metal element and the autumn season. As the tiger was considered the king of all beasts by ancient cultures, the legends speak of its tail turning white as the creature reached the age of 500 years. It is the guardian of righteousness and only appears to rulers of the highest virtues.
