The wild yak once roamed the regions between India and West China, but extensive hunting has reduced the population to a small number that now graze on elevated plateaus above 14,000 feet. It was hunted primarily for its rich meat and wooly hide. The wild yak, now endangered, has a dark brown coat and may grow to a shoulder height of more than 6 feet. Its body features a humped back, a bushy tail, and a set of long horns that spread outward and upward at the tips.

For centuries, natives of Central Asia have domesticated and crossbred the yak for use as a beast of burden, as well as for its continuous milk supply, used for quality butter and curd. They eventually introduced the domesticated yak to other parts of Asia. It can be recognized by its smaller size and its shorter horns. The domesticated yak’s coat also varies in color, and can be brown, red, black, and even albino.
