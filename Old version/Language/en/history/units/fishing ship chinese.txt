Fishing was always an important source of sustenance in the East, and the technology of fishing boats, nets, navigation, and traps was rapidly improving from the earliest years of ancient China. At first, boats called Sampans were used for fishing close to the shore. They were flat with a small shelter on board and could be used for long-term living on rivers and smaller inland waters.

The types of fishing boats kept evolving and adapting to open sea and eventually transformed into sea-worthy vessels called Junks.
