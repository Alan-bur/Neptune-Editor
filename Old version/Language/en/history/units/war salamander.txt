Arguably the largest amphibian, the War Salamander is a giant-headed creature with tiny eyes and the strength of a bear. Its sight is not its greatest asset, but the creature is covered in sensory nodes that enable it to sense even the gentlest tremors. And while the Salamander is capable of inflicting a lot of damage, it mostly sticks to fish and insects for food.

In ancient China, the creature adopted a nickname "infant fish" due to its cries strongly resembling a weeping child.
