Jungle palms can grow in differing sizes either as simple shrubs or tall trees. Some are restricted to solitary growth while others form clusters and contribute to the thick thicket of a jungle. 

Most of these trees thrive in tropical areas and their diversity increases in lowlands with higher humidity.

The palm branch served as a symbol of victory and triumph in ancient times.
