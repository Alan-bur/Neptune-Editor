The Vermilion bird is a mythological creature which represents fire, summer, and sometimes goes by the name of Vermilion bird of the South. With its multi-coloured plumage perpetually coated in flames, the Vermilion bird's dominant colour is that of fire, much like its Egyptian counterpart Phoenix. Considered a bird of elegance, it is known to sing and break into dance at will, and can even make small seeds grow into giant trees. At night, however, the elegant creature shows its far fiercer side as it dines only after sundown and feasts on snakes and serpents coated in cinnamon.
