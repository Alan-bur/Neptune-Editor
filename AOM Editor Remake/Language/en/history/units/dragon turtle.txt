The Dragon Turtle is a mythological creature whose appearance resembles both the Azure Dragon of the East and the Black Turtle of the South, as it bears the head of the former and the body of the latter. 

Ancient cultures believed the Dragon Turtle was a symbol of prosperity and longevity, but also symbolized courage and determination, which can be attributed to its fierce-looking appearance and rock-hard shell.
