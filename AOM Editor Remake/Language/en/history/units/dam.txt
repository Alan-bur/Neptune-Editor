Dams were an integral part of the economy in ancient China, especially in rural areas, which were often plagued by floods or prolonged drought. Construction of these dams was rather simple and consisted mostly of dirt and stacked stones that would restrict the flow of a river to a mere trickle, thus helping to retain a lot of water for irrigation.
