Considered the "imperial gem", jade could be found in natural deposits underground or in rivers in the form of pebbles and small boulders. Used for hardstone carving, jade was acquired by ancient civilizations to create both delicately-shaped weapons and decorative objects, among others the mouthpieces of some pipes as it was believed that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers. Precious white jade attained a higher status-value than silver or gold and served for both utilitarian and ceremonial purposes.
