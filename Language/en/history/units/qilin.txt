Believed to be a good omen, Qilin is a mythical creature from the far east resembling a hooved dragon with antlers and sometimes fire, which covers parts of its body. Despite its formidable appearance, Qilin was considered a peaceful creature. It would appear to wise rulers and bestow luck and prosperity, and it would only reveal its ferocious side if a pure cause was threatened. Various depictions and stories include Qilin gliding on clouds so as to not harm a single blade of grass or a living creature.
