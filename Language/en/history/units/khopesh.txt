With up to 24 inches in length, Khopesh is an ancient sword-like weapon with a curved end that comes from ancient Egypt. It is believed to have evolved from battle axes but despite its fierce appearance, the weapon's inside edge at the tip was blunted, thereby enabling the weapon to be used also as a hook or a club. Khopesh may also have served as a ceremonial weapon, in which case none of its edges would be sharpened.
