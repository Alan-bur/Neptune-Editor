Original Name -- Jiangshi
Size -- 6 ft tall
Diet -- The qi of all living creatures

Jiangshi, sometimes called a hopping zombie, was known throughout ancient China as a reanimated corpse that would hunt and seek all living creatures in an attempt to kill them and harvest their qi, loosely translated as "life force".

The nickname hopping zombie was assigned to the phenomenon due to the corpse being too stiff to bend any of its limbs and thus resorting to jumping with arms outstretched.
