Jiao-Long grew up in a family close to the court of Emperor Yao. He made a steady career in the Imperial Army, fighting off bandits and hostile clans in the most barren regions of the Empire. As he earned a stellar reputation in the army, he was asked by the Emperor to serve close to him in the Capital. However, Jiao-Long politely declined so he could stay closer to the rural population, which he vowed to protect as well. 

Although China was experiencing great prosperity and relative peace during the long reign of Emperor Yao, Jiao-Long stayed alert, knowing that one day, he would need his skills to fight greater foes.
