At the Stable, players with the Chinese civilization can train different types of mounted units, and research various technologies to improve their quality and make them more effective.

Mounted warriors brought a new dimension to war and combat. They were highly effective both as raiders and as fighters in an open battlefield. Raiders charging on horseback were terrifying to men on foot, and they could easily chase down fleeing enemies and plunder villages. The rise in importance of mounted warriors created demand for large numbers of horses, which were bred and maintained at the Stable, where the mounted warriors also trained, learning the skills of fighting from horseback.
